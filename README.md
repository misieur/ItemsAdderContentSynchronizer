This is a Paper plugin made for 1.20.1+, it allows you to automatically synchronize your ItemsAdder contents folder with a public or private GitHub repository that you own.
It will automatically create a webhook on your repository using the given configuration to know exactly when a new release is published and update your server's contents folder and resource pack â€” it is made to work on multiple server at the time.
